Version1:
-> DataSet Size: 4096
-> DataSet from: "Potato Leaf Disease Dataset from pakistan farm"
-> Activation function used: "RELU"
-> CNN model used: "Modified version of VGG"
-> Kernel size for Convolution: (3,3)
-> Kernel size for pooling: (2,2)
-> Type of Pooling: MaxPooling
-> Number of layers: |-> 12 Convolutional layers
		     |-> 1 flatten layer
		     |-> 1 dense layer
		     |-> 1 softmax layer
-> Epochs: 50
-> Dataset divided into: | 80% training
			 | 10% validation
			 | 10% testing
-> batch size: 32
-> Image is resized into: (256,256,3)
-> Normalized each pixel between [0,1]
-> Data Augumentation: | -> Horizontial_and_Vertical_Flip
		       | -> Image Rotation: 0.2
-> Optimizer: "Adam"
-> Accuracy for test data: 98%
-> Loss for test data: 0.0519
-> Observation: 
   1) Seen that the model will almost result the same accuracy even with less number of epochs(35)
   2) The model perform well when the given image contains only one leaf which is placed on a plane
      surface
   3) The model does not perform well when the image contains noise(containing more than one leaf in an image)
   4) The model does not perform well even when the image contains dark color background.
